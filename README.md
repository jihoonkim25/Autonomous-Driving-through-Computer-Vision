# Autonomous-Driving-through-Computer-Vision
A suite of Autonomous Driving AI/Computer Vision solutions including traffic-sign detection using RCNN, lane detection, and pedestrian detection made by Jihoon Kim and Martin Liu 

## Traffic Sign Detection (traffic.py, filter.py)
Using a custom made RCNN, we have made a Tensorflow Model trained from the LISA Traffic Sign Dataset.
We then used a variety of filters and contours to detect traffic signs from dash cam footage to feed into the trained model.

## Lane Detection (perspective.py)
 

## Pedestrian Detection (perspective.py)
We implemented an OpenCV model, HOGDescriptor, to detect and box Pedestrians from dash cam footage.
